":dfn:`Objects` are Python's abstraction for data.  All data in a Python "

"Every object has an identity, a type and a value.  An object's *identity* "
"never changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object's "

"objects; the :func:`id` function returns an integer representing its "
"identity."

"\"does it have a length?\") and also defines the possible values for objects"

" an object itself).  Like its identity, an object's :dfn:`type` is also "
"unchangeable. [#]_"

"The *value* of some objects can change.  Objects whose value can change are "
"said to be *mutable*; objects whose value is unchangeable once they are "
"created are called *immutable*. (The value of an immutable container object "
"that contains a reference to a mutable object can change when the latter's "
"value is changed; however the container is still considered immutable, "
"because the collection of objects it contains cannot be changed.  So, "
"immutability is not strictly the same as having an unchangeable value, it is"
" more subtle.) An object's mutability is determined by its type; for "
"instance, numbers, strings and tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and "
"lists are mutable."

"objects are collected that are still reachable."

"CPython currently uses a reference-counting scheme with (optional) delayed "
"detection of cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon "
"as they become unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage "
"containing circular references.  See the documentation of the :mod:`gc` "
"module for information on controlling the collection of cyclic garbage. "
"Other implementations act differently and CPython may change. Do not depend "
"on immediate finalization of objects when they become unreachable (so you "
"should always close files explicitly)."

"Some objects contain references to \"external\" resources such as open files"
" or windows.  It is understood that these resources are freed when the "
"object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed "
"to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external"
" resource, usually a :meth:`!close` method. Programs are strongly "
"recommended to explicitly close such objects.  The :keyword:`try`...\\ "

"Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called "
"*containers*. Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries.  "
"The references are part of a container's value.  In most cases, when we talk"
" about the value of a container, we imply the values, not the identities of "
"the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability of a "
"container, only the identities of the immediately contained objects are "
"implied.  So, if an immutable container (like a tuple) contains a reference "
"to a mutable object, its value changes if that mutable object is changed."

"Types affect almost all aspects of object behavior.  Even the importance of "
"object identity is affected in some sense: for immutable types, operations "
"that compute new values may actually return a reference to any existing "
"object with the same type and value, while for mutable objects this is not "
"allowed. For example, after ``a = 1; b = 1``, *a* and *b* may or may not "
"refer to the same object with the value one, depending on the "
"implementation. This is because :class:`int` is an immutable type, so the "
"reference to ``1`` can be reused. This behaviour depends on the "
"implementation used, so should not be relied upon, but is something to be "
"aware of when making use of object identity tests. However, after ``c = []; "
"d = []``, *c* and *d* are guaranteed to refer to two different, unique, "
"newly created empty lists. (Note that ``e = f = []`` assigns the *same* "
