"Unlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not include a system "
"supported installation of Python. Instead, Python can be obtained from a "
"number of distributors, including directly from the CPython team. Each "
"Python distribution will have its own benefits and drawbacks, however, "
"consistency with other tools you are using is generally a worthwhile "

"In general, we recommend that you create a :ref:`virtual environment <tut-"
