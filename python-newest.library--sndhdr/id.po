"The :mod:`sndhdr` provides utility functions which attempt to determine the "
"type of sound data which is in a file.  When these functions are able to "
"determine what type of sound data is stored in a file, they return a "
":func:`~collections.namedtuple`, containing five attributes: (``filetype``, "
"``framerate``, ``nchannels``, ``nframes``, ``sampwidth``). The value for "
"*type* indicates the data type and will be one of the strings ``'aifc'``, "
"``'aiff'``, ``'au'``, ``'hcom'``, ``'sndr'``, ``'sndt'``, ``'voc'``, "
"``'wav'``, ``'8svx'``, ``'sb'``, ``'ub'``, or ``'ul'``.  The *sampling_rate*"
" will be either the actual value or ``0`` if unknown or difficult to decode."
"  Similarly, *channels* will be either the number of channels or ``0`` if it"
" cannot be determined or if the value is difficult to decode.  The value for"
" *frames* will be either the number of frames or ``-1``.  The last item in "
"the tuple, *bits_per_sample*, will either be the sample size in bits or "
"``'A'`` for A-LAW or ``'U'`` for u-LAW."
