"Before Python 3.14, old-style unions were implemented using the private "
"class ``typing._UnionGenericAlias``. This class is no longer needed for the "
"implementation, but it has been retained for backward compatibility, with "
"removal scheduled for Python 3.17. Users should use documented introspection"
" helpers like :func:`typing.get_origin` and :func:`typing.get_args` instead "
"of relying on private implementation details."
