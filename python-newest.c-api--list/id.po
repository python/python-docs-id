"If *len* is greater than zero, the returned list object's items are set to "

":c:func:`PySequence_SetItem` or expose the object to Python code before "
"setting all items to a real object with :c:func:`PyList_SetItem` or "
":c:func:`PyList_SET_ITEM()`. The following APIs are safe APIs before the "
"list is fully initialized: :c:func:`PyList_SetItem()` and "
":c:func:`PyList_SET_ITEM()`."
